# Volcanoes-of-US
Created using Python, folium and pandas
Contains a html file that when you run the program the html file will create a webpage that contains a map of the world and 
has markers on the map to mark where a volcano is in the United States. If you click on the marker it will display information for the volcano. 
Created to play with and create a simple program that reads a file and uses pandas to create a data structure for the data
and to make a map containing the data.
